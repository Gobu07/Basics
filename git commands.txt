How does a Git works:
Set up a git username and email for the account:
1)git config --global user.name "Govind" //To enetr a username 
2)git config --global user.email "govindmisharaalld@gmail.com" //
3)git config --list //To see what all functions are there and what role are they playing
4)clear  //This command will clear ur screen with every previous stuff saved on the PC.
5) git help // This commmand will give us all the possible helps
6) git help commit/run // These will pop up a HTML page stating what you want help with.



7) Eitehr on cmd or gitbash typing pwd on the web would always tells us where exactly we are in the git 
Going Back in cmd -------------------------->  cd ..
Listing all folders in that directory ------> ls
