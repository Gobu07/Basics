Here, git commit -am "changes made " // this commad will directly make all files save to the repository and will ot go the staging area.
but this command should be used when small changes are to be made.

1) What checkout means is taking a file from your repository and making it your working file. This is done especially when the working file is messed up
or got tattered in any particular fashion.
 So, git checkout -- index.html // this will checkout one file from the repository and make it our working file
 
 
2)Now, if we have added any file to staging area like after <git add .> , and if we want to take it back to working and improve the file further then 
we should use <git reset HEAD filename> and this will make it unstagged,

3) To add any folder into git repository, enter in the folder via the bash and after that do git init in the folder and that would be started as a product.
and then commit them

1)So, if i am working on a project and as i try stuffs on index.html and have commited it all the time like say i said commit1 , commit 2, commit 3, commit 4 and 
so onn , then if after commit 4 my file looks totally fucked_up,then what i would do is i would like to work on a previous version of my commit and i would do it
by writing a command [git checkout(first few commit words ) and then after the  -- name of the file]. We can see the name of the files in the git log
== Now commit the saved values as kevins mistakes has to be avoided.

Git and GitHub -- Git is for keeping track of your files on the machine and edit the files from there and github would be like everyone can use the files 
and they can also work on it if needed.
We create a git init in a particular folder to track the git changs and this have to take nothing with how we have to dealwith the git hub

#) Push == push means pushing a file on the server from the working directory 
#) Fetch == Fetch means taking a file from the server which u like or love to work on and taking it to your local computer.
#) set up a remote name of a github repository === [[{git remote add mine_tutorials https://github.com/Govind273/tutorals.git}]], so what this did is created a name
mine_tutorials for my repository tutorials, and it's address as it must have the address of my git hib repo....

git remote -v ---->> shows all the repositories on the github.
OKKKAAAAAYYYY, SO if we create a repository we can address it by any name we desire ..okaay by git add remote name and then url oaky and if we are cloning anything it always 
by default named as origin...even that we can change if required.

git remote :enter will show u all the repos or the one u are naming !! like mine_tutorials
#)Now we have set up a git repository and called it by a local name..so how to push anything onto the github ??
git push -u mine_tutorials master: this will select all( u ) and then pushes everythinhg on turtoruals repo nd then enter username and password

Many a times we don't want to have some files in our local machine like java class files and stuff that are not use for the programs then we use gitgnore
so adding a file in the gitgnore make it stay on local machine but not on the web .
&&)I wasn't able to exit my account from the PC on git so after searching i got a SF link which said to control >web credentials>delete git account, if 
want to enter with a different account later time.
