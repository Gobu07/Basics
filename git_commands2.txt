Here, git commit -am "changes made " // this commad will directly make all files save to the repository and will ot go the staging area.
but this command should be used when small changes are to be made.

1) What checkout means is taking a file from your repository and making it your working file. This is done especially when the working file is messed up
or got tattered in any particular fashion.
 So, git checkout -- index.html // this will checkout one file from the repository and make it our working file
 
 
2)Now, if we have added any file to staging area like after <git add .> , and if we want to take it back to working and improve the file further then 
we should use <git reset HEAD filename> and this will make it unstagged.
